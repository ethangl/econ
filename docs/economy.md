# Economy Design

### Philosophy

Build the economy in layers, each adding one mechanism. Every layer must run and produce observable data before the next begins. No speculative infrastructure.

Update the econ debug bridge and `analyze_econ.py` with every change.

### [Completed Layers](./economy-complete.md)

1. Autarky
2. Feudal Tax Redistribution
3. Multiple Goods
4. Inter-Realm Trade
5. Population Dynamics
6. Good Spoilage / Decay
7. Production Chains
8. Domestic cash flow
9. County Market Access

### Future Layers (unordered)

- **Market Location** - the market should be assigned to a county and generate tax revenue of its own
- **Weather/Seasonality**
- **Money circulation + market tolls** — Market towns accumulate coin from tolls → grow in population → attract more trade (feedback loop). Counties respond to high market prices by producing above quota (price signal = demand signal).
- **Labor specialization** — unskilled vs craftsman, skill acquisition from employment
- **Road emergence** — traffic volume builds paths → roads, reducing transport cost
- **Political effects** — ~~tariffs at realm borders~~, trade agreements
- **Black markets** — theft, smuggling, informal economy
